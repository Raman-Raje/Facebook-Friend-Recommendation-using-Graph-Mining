This repositary belongs to Facebook Friend Recommendation using Graph Mining case study

## About Dataset:
* Our dataset is directed graph data
* We have approx. 1.86M nodes and 9.43M edges.
* Data was obtained from kaggle. You can get data from here https://www.kaggle.com/c/FacebookRecruiting 
* We have provided only connected nodes. i.e. 9.43M edges. But for each user among n user's, there is n-1 edges. So, for n nodes total possible edges are of 10^12 oreder. 

## Performance metric:
* Both precision and recall is important so F1 score is good choice
* Confusion matrix
